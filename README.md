In the MAIN file you will find all path functions. Primarily we will focus on the Radius_run2.
The Dijkstra_run is there mainly to demonstrate how my Dijkstra implementation went, it also has documentation.

In FUNCTIONS you will find three different functions that has made the Radius_run2 a lot more compact and reviewable.
All that you have to know about these functions is documented in docstrings.

The most important file is the GUI.
  - In order to test my app, you first run the GUI.
  - If you haven't done so, pick two coördinates in the same city.
    for demonstration purposes it's best to use the coördinates I gave,
    these are found at the bottom of the file.
  - Follow the CLI instructions
  - A window will pop up with your route
  - It's that easy :)
